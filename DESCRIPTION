Description: Provides a reference class and several utility methods to
    facilitate the implementation of models based on ordinary
    differential equations. The heart of the package is a code generator
    that creates compiled 'Fortran' (or 'R') code which can be passed to
    a numerical solver. There is direct support for solvers contained
    in packages 'deSolve' and 'rootSolve'.
