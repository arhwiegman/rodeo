Description: Provides a reference class and several utility methods to
    facilitate the implementation of models based on ordinary
    differential equations. The heart of the package is a code generator
    that creates compiled Fortran (or R) code which can be passed to a
    numerical solver. There is direct support for the solvers contained
    in the deSolve and rootSolve packages.
