Demonstrates the solution of a 1D partial differential equation problem by means of semi-discretization known as the [method-of-lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines). The model simulates the transport of a conservative tracer along a river reach assuming steady-uniform flow (i.e. constant flow rate, uniform cross-section). The result of numerical integration is (visually) compared to a classic analytical solution.
