The model simulates aerobic 1st-order decay of a substance in a stirred tank reactor without in-/outflow. The state variables are degradable organic matter (OM) and dissolved oxygen (DO). This is in contrast to the classical Streeter-Phelps model which considers biochemical oxygen demand, BOD, (rather than OM) and the oxygen deficit (rather than DO). The model is reduced to the very basics. It does not account for oxygen limitation, hence, it returns non-sense if the system goes anaerobic. Furthermore, the model neglects temperature dependence of micribioal activity, it does not distinguish between CBOD and NBOD, there is no interaction between water and sediment, ...
